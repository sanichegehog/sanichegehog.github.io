  <H1> An analytical examination on the history of memes
</div>
<div class= "Fredbody"> 
  <p> The word "meme" originated with scientist Richard Dawkins in his book "The Selfish Gene".  Evolution, according to Dawkins, did not depend on the specific chemical basis of genetics, but only on the existence of a self-replicating unit of transmission — in the case of biological evolution, the gene.
    
    A meme is a sort of parellel to this replication of genes. The exact definition of a meme is "an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture". </p>
  <h3> Internet Memes </h3>
<p>The first major internet meme was Greenoch, the original flamewar. The meme, created in 1991 by Doug Welch, and was a fictional Celtic martial arts. Many believed him, and a debate ensued to see who understood the true “Greenoch” Soon, it was described in detail, with styles, weapons, and the whole 9 yards fought over and debated. Nobody won of course, but it had its place as the first flame war in internet history.</p>
